# GPT-2 Shakespeare Model: Training GPT2 from Scratch with Advanced Optimization

## Project Overview

This project involves building and training a GPT-2 model from scratch over the works of Shakespeare, with a strong focus on optimizing the training process. The model architecture is based on the decoder-only transformer outlined in the original GPT-2 paper, comprising 124 million parameters. By implementing a range of techniques, the training time was significantly reduced while maintaining high performance, achieving a loss of 0.09 in just 4 hours on Google Colab.

## Key Features

- **Model Architecture**: 
  - Implemented a decoder-only transformer using 124 million parameters.
  - Utilized the Tiktoken library for efficient tokenization, including encoding and decoding.

- **Training Optimization**:
  - **TF32 Computation**: Switched from FP32 to TF32, resulting in a 3x speed improvement in training.
  - **Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)**: Used BF16 precision for attention matrix computation, while retaining high precision for backpropagation.
  - **Optimized Kernels**: Leveraged `torch.compile()` and FlashAttention for more efficient kernel execution, leading to a 67% reduction in training time.
  - **Gradient Clipping & Optimizers**: Applied gradient clipping for training stability, used fused AdamW optimizer, and implemented a learning rate scheduler for smooth convergence.

## Results

- The model was trained to a loss of 0.09 in just 4 hours on Google Colab.
- Training optimizations resulted in dramatic reductions in training time while preserving model accuracy.
